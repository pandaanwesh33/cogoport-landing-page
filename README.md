Difficulties Faced : 
1) Combining different sections in a container :
   At first I put all individual sections e.g in different containers. But without common parent container of some sections the number of classes required were large and the CSS code became redundant. So I learnt from official website how and why they are combining some of the sections.
2) Making the website responsive : 
   i) “ min-width : fit-content “ in the main container which contains all the section
       If I include this, almost all responsive code is working as expected, but which reducing, the contents are not adapting to the screen size till 767. Its going out of screen and below 767 everything working fine.
       If I not include this, then a white space is remaining in the right part since some objects are going out of the container and also the width of all the elements is not proper.
 		   (Not able to completely understand this part)
  ii)  Laptop section was difficult but did it using trial and error.
  iii) Marquee not occupying complete width of parent container below 700px
       Tried it many a times but the arrangement is becoming disoriented. 
3) Still facing some issues in Flexbox
   I am able to position elements by trial and error but still learning to properly visualize the positions the elements will be kept with different properties.
