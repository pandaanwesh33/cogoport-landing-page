Major task was to make the website responsive, There are some areas where it needs to be improved like <br>
1) The positioning of the "product" section after the screen size gets smaller. <br>
2) The size of the laptop image (in the "how it works section" exceeds the size of the body width, when width of screen is greater than 767. <br>
3) In the introduction section the video doesn't changes when reducing/increasing the size of the screen. <br>
4) When screen size is less than 767 then a white margin remains in the right side. <br>
